Weighted Starfield Stabilizer - Medium Level
Welcome, Space Cowboy. The resistance has intercepted energy signals from the Frontier Starfield, but they are riddled with weighted anomalies that distort their stability. To analyze the starfield’s stability, you must calculate the maximum stability score.

Each energy signal is modified by its corresponding weight, creating a new stability signal:
Modified Signal = Signal × Weight

Your mission is to identify the maximum stability score for any contiguous subarray of the modified signals. Use your computational skills to ensure the accuracy of your findings!

Answer Format:
Return a single integer representing the maximum stability score from the starfield.

Report your findings to Lena Starling. The resistance depends on your precision to restore balance in the starfield!

Example
Input
Input:
signals = [1, -2, 3, -4]
weights = [2, 3, -1, 4]

Output
Output:
48
Explanation:
To compute the maximum stability score, follow these steps:

Calculate the modified signals:
1 × 2 = 2
-2 × 3 = -6
3 × -1 = -3
-4 × 4 = -16
The modified signals are:
[2, -6, -3, -16]
Find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray:
Subarray
[2] : Product = 2
Subarray
[-6] : Product = -6
Subarray
[2, -6] : Product = -12
Subarray
[-3, -16] : Product = 48
The maximum product is 48, which occurs for the subarray
[-3, -16]
