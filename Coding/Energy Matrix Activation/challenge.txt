Energy Matrix Activation - Easy Level
Greetings, Space Cowboy. The resistance has uncovered the ancient Starry Spur, but its power lies dormant. To activate the energy matrix, you must combine specific energy crystals to reach a precise energy level.

Your mission is to calculate the number of ways to combine these crystals to match the required energy level. Each crystal can be used an unlimited number of times, but the combinations must add up to the exact target energy.

Report the number of valid combinations to Lena Starling. The fate of the resistance rests in your calculations!

Example
Input
Example 1:
Energy Crystals: [1, 2, 3]
Target Energy: 4

Example 2:
Energy Crystals: [2, 5, 3, 6]
Target Energy: 10

Output
Example 1 Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 distinct ways to combine the crystals to reach the target energy level of 4:

1 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 2
2 + 2
1 + 3
Example 2 Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 distinct ways to combine the crystals to reach the target energy level of 10:

2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
2 + 2 + 6
2 + 3 + 5
2 + 2 + 3 + 3
5 + 5
Each combination adds up to the target energy level of 10. As before, the order of the crystals does not matter.
